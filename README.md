# jupyter-computervision-docker
üê≥ Docker Container for creating Jupyter Notebooks for Computer Vision on ARM64

# Running

```
docker run -v /host/directory:/home/jovyan -it -p 8888:8888 123marvin123/jupyter-computervision
```

This will create a docker container, running on port ```8888```. The console will output a corresponding url for visiting the jupyter hub instance, including the access token:

```

## Using OpenCV

The mandatory system libraries for OpenCV are preinstalled in this image, including the python package for the bindings. After creating a notebook, you can simply
import the ```cv2``` package and use it as usual:

```python
import cv2

cv2.imread('image.png)
```

# Building

```
docker build -t "123marvin123/jupyter-computervision:latest" .
